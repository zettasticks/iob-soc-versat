First of all, I should have a single test for any thing.
Any small thing should be one test.
Any combination possible should be another.
Need merge tests for 2,3,4 types.
Need complex merge tests for 2,3,4 types.

It is probably a good idea to add tests for the flatten algorithm.
If we make it so a flattened graph contains the same interface as the normal type, then we can reuse the same tests wether the unit is flattened or not. Just pass a different flag to test
